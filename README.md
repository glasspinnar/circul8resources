**Guidelines**

* A stroke width of 6 px width rounded appearance is the golden standard.
* Use only the supplied gradients.
* Stay "inbounds" with the glyph size.


**Illustrator**
Choose expand, outline stroke or similar before copying.
Open one of the .psds in photoshop and run the Illustrator Paste action.


**Submitting icons**
Please include all icon sizes so that the icon you've created can be used to theme other apps.
Also add the source psds to glyphs here.
